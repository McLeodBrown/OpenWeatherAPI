2. Parse the Python variables returned by the API to extract the the minimum and maximum forecast temperature temperatureMini and temperatureMaxi in Celsius for each of the upcoming five (5) days.
3. Compute the average minimum and maximum forecast temperatures Minavg and Maxavg for the upcoming five (5) days.
4. Write the location description loc we provide below, the five minimum and maximum forecast temperatures, and the overall minimum and maximum forecast temperatures to a CSV file named temp.csv, one line per city.
